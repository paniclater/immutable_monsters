1. Talk about what the words mutability and immutability mean in this context []
1. Demonstrate immutable operations with single values
 - primitives
 - objects
1. Demonstrate immutable operations on lists of values
 - primitives
 - objects
1. Demonstrate operating on single values with list operations!
1. Introduce functional, immutable data structures
 - ImmutableJS
 - Immutable Extensions

What The Diddly Do I Mean By Immutable?

1. Simple Mutable Patterns, or **Frugality: Using What You've Got**
TODO: find a gif!
 - example of mutating object in place
 - example of mutating list in place
1. Simple Immutabality **Life of Luxury: Never Use The Same Thing Twice**

 - example of getting new object w/o mutation
 - example of getting new list w/o mutation
1. Example of How Things Get Scary With Mutation
